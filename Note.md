 Innovation in Financial Product to Mitigate Short/Medium Term Catastrophic Economic Impacts: 
 One of the primary roles of financial markets is to share risks and in the process mitigate the extreme impacts of climate risk. 
 The natural question arises: why aren’t markets already playing a bigger role in the systemic risks and uncertainties created by global climate challenges?
 Why aren’t financial markets offering ways to share and mitigate climate risk? When we talk about sharing risks and mitigating the adverse economic impacts, 
 we’re talking about various forms of insurance products. And right now, if you are worried about climate change, 
 you simply cannot buy insurance to protect yourself.
